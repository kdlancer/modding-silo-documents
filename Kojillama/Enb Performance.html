<p>This guide will show you exactly what settings to change in your ENB preset to increase performance and get more FPS. We\u2019ll outline what settings can be changed, what each of the settings does, and how to get the most performance out of them with the least loss of visual quality.</p>",
<p>There are 2 main files and 1 directory we\u2019ll be dealing with in this guide:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>enbseries.ini</strong>  This file can be found in your root game folder where the game\u2019s executable file (Skyrim.exe or SkyrimSE.exe) is. This deals with all the nitty gritty of how an ENB preset looks.<br /><br /></li>
    <li><strong>enblocal.ini</strong>  This file can be found alongside the enbseries.ini file, as stated above. If the file is missing, it will be automatically. generated on first launch with any ENB preset. This deals with more global variables of how the ENB system operates, and is not specific to a preset.<br /><br /></li>
    <li><strong>enbcache</strong>  This directory stores shader information about an ENB preset that helps improve performance and speed up launch time. It is automatically generated if it is needed, and should be deleted whenever a change it made to the enbseries.ini file. This may not always exist in some configurations.<br /><br /></li>
    <li><strong>Quality Settings</strong>  For most settings that have <strong>QUALITY</strong> in the name, there is a set highest to lowest range. They are as follows:<br />-1: Ultra quality (This is largely unnecessary, unless you have a very good gaming rig and are aiming for screen archery)<br />0: High quality<br />1: Medium quality<br />2: Low quality<br /><br /></li>
</ol>
<p>Please make sure to <strong>backup your enbseries.ini file and enblocal.ini file</strong> before making any of the changes outlined in this guide. That way you can easily go back if you don\u2019t like anything. As well, please <strong>delete you enbcache directory</strong> prior to continuing, if you have one. This is perfectly safe to do.</p>
<p>Under the&nbsp;<code><span style="color: #ff6600;">[PERFORMANCE]&nbsp;</span></code>heading:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>SpeedHack=true</code></span><br>This setting should be left on&nbsp;<strong>true</strong>&nbsp;default, however it should have no effect on Skyrim SE/AE as it is a left-over from Oldrim.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>ShaderCache=true<br></code></span>This setting should generally be set to&nbsp;<strong>true</strong>&nbsp;and will make the most difference on slower hard drives and older systems. When enabled, the first time your game starts it will take a bit longer as ENB storing information on how to make the game run better in the enbcache folder. Every subsequent game run should faster and smoother. Just make sure to delete that enbcache folder every time you make a change to any of your ENB files!</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>ENBLITE=false</code></span><br>This settings should&nbsp;<strong>ALWAYS be set to false, unless your preset has it set to true by default</strong>. If disabled, many critical lighting settings that are essential to every preset will be removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>[ENGINE]</code></span>&nbsp;heading:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>ForceVSync=false</code></span><br>VSync reduces FPS and prevents screen tearing at the cost of input lag. Make sure that VSync should always to&nbsp;<strong>false</strong>&nbsp;here, in the Skyrim game settings, and your driver settings. Then the&nbsp;<strong>FPSLimit</strong>&nbsp;below should be used in combination to give you the best performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the&nbsp;<code><span style="color: #ff6600;">[LIMITER]</span></code>&nbsp;heading:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>EnableFPSLimit=true</code></span><br>This will make sure your gameplay is smooth and removes screen tearing. Make sure to set this to&nbsp;<strong>true</strong>, along with adjusting the&nbsp;<strong>FPSLimit</strong>&nbsp;setting below.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>FPSLimit=61</code></span><br>This should be set to your screen refresh rate plus 1 to make full use of the above settings. I recommend disabling driver and game setting FPS limits and using this one instead for convenience.<br><br>*The value might be different if you're using GSync/FreeSync or frame generation.</li>

<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>EnableEdgeAA=false<br></code></span>Antialiasing removed jagged edges in Skyrim. For best performance and visual quality, I recommend using Skyrim\u2019s built-in TAA antialiasing from the game settings and setting this to&nbsp;<strong>false</strong>. Bonus points if you know what DLSS or DLAA are and use one of them instead!</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the&nbsp;<code><span style="color: #ff6600;">[EFFECT]</span></code>&nbsp;heading:</p>
<p>Almost every setting should be left alone here with the exception of the following </p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>EnableCloudShadows=false<br></code></span><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/images/189406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[The effect can be viewed here]</a><br>While shadows cast by clouds on the ground will add a small amount of realism to the game at the cost of performance, most people will not actually notice them during regular gameplay. I recommend setting this to&nbsp;<strong>false</strong>&nbsp;unless you have a modern gaming rig.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>EnableAmbientOcclusion=true<br></code></span><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/images/18402" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[The effect can be viewed here]</a><br>This setting enhances realism in the game by making shadows more realistic. While it\u2019s a heavy feature, it\u2019s certainly worth the performance cost to get the increase in quality and so I HIGHLY recommend leaving this to&nbsp;<strong>true</strong>&nbsp;for everyone. Further down on this page, I\u2019ll describe how to leave this enabled and still get good performance out of it.<br><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Make sure to turn off Skyrim\u2019s built-in Ambient Occlusion settings, as they will conflict with ENB\u2019s.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>EnableComplexFireLights=false<br></code></span>This setting makes fire lights interact more realistically with the environment. This setting should be&nbsp;<strong>false</strong>&nbsp;for EVERYONE, even if you have a very strong gaming rig. There is no discernible quality improvement, however the performance loss is very heavy.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>EnableComplexParticleLights=false</code></span><br>This setting will allow each light source such as a candle or weapon effect interact individually with the environment. It has a high performance cost, however it greatly improves realism and visual quality. I recommend setting this to&nbsp;<strong>false</strong>, unless you have a modern gaming rig. Every additional light source in a scene will cost more performance.<br><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/images/35559" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[The effect can be viewed here]</a>
</li>
<li><strong>Parallax Guide:<br></strong><br>Parallax is when a texture looks bumpy and 3D, despite it being a 2D texture. It requires a special mesh and texture, however the results are astounding. An example of the effect can be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F6vd4eqeeg0la1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">viewed here</a>.<br>There are two types of parallax: Simple and Complex 
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>EnableTerrainParallax=false<br></code></span>This is simple parallax that affects the terrain. Simple parallax has all the bumps but the bumps don\u2019t produce shadows. Enable this option increased the use of video memory and had a medium impact on performance. This should be set to&nbsp;<strong>true</strong>&nbsp;only if you\u2019ve downloaded parallax texture and mesh mods and have a gaming system that\u2019s relatively new (2-3 years), otherwise set to&nbsp;<strong>false</strong>. Simple parallax only affects terrains.</li>
<li><code><span style="color: #ff6600;">EnableComplexTerrainParallax=false</span><br><span style="color: #ff6600;">EnableComplexTerrainParallaxShadows=false</span><br><span style="color: #ff6600;">EnableTerrainBlending=false</span><br></code>These are the options to enable complex parallax, which is a more accurate version of parallax that uses even more video memory and has a HEAVY performance impact. These setting should be set to&nbsp;<strong>true</strong>&nbsp;on new gaming rigs that have no issues with performance, otherwise set to false. There will be options detailed further down in this article on how to increase performance, if you need to use this feature.</li>
<li><code><span style="color: #ff6600;">EnableComplexParallax=false</span><br><span style="color: #ff6600;">EnableComplexParallaxShadows=false</span><br></code>These are the same as Complex Terrain Parallax (see above) except they apply to surfaces other than landscapes, such as wall and objects. Again, these setting should be set to&nbsp;<strong>true</strong>&nbsp;on new gaming rigs that have no issues with performance, otherwise set to false. There will be options detailed further down in this article on how to increase performance, if you need to use this feature.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>EnableComplexGrass=false<br>EnableComplexGrassCollisions=false<br></code></span>Complex grass allows for grass allows for each blade of glass to receive accurate lighting to increase immersion. This is another heavy setting that will decrease performance and require more vram on your graphics card. If you do use this setting however, you can also get grass collisions, which means that grass will move if you or an NPC set on it. I recommend setting this to&nbsp;<strong>false</strong>&nbsp;for most people, unless you really value grass collisions.<br><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/images/148977" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[The effect can be viewed here]</a></li>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>EnableComplexMaterial=false<br></code></span>Complex material is a feature which allows ENB to render objects more accurately and make them look more realistic (metals look more metallic, etc). You need a texture pack that specifically supports this feature, and those are very rare. I recommend setting this feature to&nbsp;<strong>false</strong>, as it uses significantly more vram and provides little benefit for most people.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>EnableDynamicCubemap=false<br></code></span>This setting allows ENB to create more accurate reflections that represent the surrounding environment. While it looks nice, it\u2019s still a very new feature that can be buggy and can also be performance heavy. I recommend setting this feature to&nbsp;<strong>false</strong>&nbsp;for most people, except to experiment with it.<br><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/images/199261" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[The effect can be viewed here]</a>

These are CPU and GPU heavy settings that allow ENB to more accurately display shadows. They have minor visual impact, unless you\u2019re playing at resolution of 1440p or higher, and have a significant performance impact. I recommend turning these to&nbsp;<strong>false</strong>, unless you have a new gaming GPU and CPU.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>ResolutionScale=0.35<br></code></span>If your ENB preset comes with a value higher than this, then I recommend lower it to&nbsp;<strong>0.35</strong>. This will lower the performance impact of ambient occlusion with little different in quality.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>SamplingQuality=1<br></code></span>This defines the quality of the SSAO. I recommend setting this to&nbsp;<strong>0</strong>&nbsp;(high) for new gaming PCs, otherwise set this to&nbsp;<strong>1</strong>&nbsp;(medium).</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>OptimizeCaching=true<br></code></span>This setting should be set to&nbsp;<strong>true</strong>&nbsp;on ALL systems, whether new or not. It provides a boost in performance with no cost to visual quality.

<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>EnableShadow=false<br>EnableNormalMappingShadows=false<br></code></span>If you opted to enable Complex Particle Lights at the top of this document, then you can set these settings to&nbsp;<strong>false</strong>&nbsp;for a small boost in performance. When true, these allow light sources like candles to produce shadows.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>ShadowQuality=2<br>NormalMappingShadowsQuality=2<br></code></span>Even if you want to enable shadows for complex fire lights, as outlined in the point above, I highly recommend leaving the quality of the shadows to&nbsp;<strong>2</strong>&nbsp;(low). This should be set to this for even brand new gaming rigs as there is virtually no difference in visual quality.

<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>Quality=1</code></span><br>In the most simple terms, this defines the quality of lighting on skins, that is to say the skin of creatures and people. This should generally set to&nbsp;<strong>1&nbsp;</strong>(medium) for most PC, unless you have a newer gaming PC or would like to do take close-up screenshots in which case it can be set to&nbsp;<strong>0</strong>&nbsp;(high).

<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>DetailedShadowQuality=1<br></code></span>This is sets the quality of exterior detailed shadows. I recommend setting this to&nbsp;<strong>1</strong>&nbsp;(medium) for most PCs,&nbsp;<strong>-1</strong>&nbsp;(ultra) for new PCs,&nbsp;<strong>2</strong>&nbsp;(low) for older PCs.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>DetailedShadowInteriorQuality=1<br></code></span>Much like the above, except it only applied to interiors. Use the same settings as you did above.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>EnableDistantShadowAtNight=false<br></code></span>This defines whether you see shadows of distant objects like trees at night. It should be set to&nbsp;<strong>false</strong>&nbsp;on older PCs and&nbsp;<strong>true</strong>&nbsp;on newer PCs.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>ShadowQuality=1<br></code></span>This determines the overall quality for all shadows.

<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>EnableTemporalAA=false<br></code></span>This controls the display of jagged edges on water reflections and surface. I recommend leaving this to&nbsp;<strong>false</strong>&nbsp;for most people, unless you have a newer gaming rig.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>DisableDistantReflection=true<br></code></span>As the name implies, this controls whether or not water in the distance has reflections. This should be set to&nbsp;<strong>true</strong>&nbsp;for most people, even if you have a newer gaming rig, as distant water reflections generally look very bad.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>EnableParallax=true<br>EnableDisplacement=true<br>EnableTessellation=true<br></code></span>These settings control how \u201cbumpy\u201d and 3D the water surface the water looks. It\u2019s a cool effect and I recommend leaving them all on&nbsp;<strong>true</strong>&nbsp;for most people unless they have a very old or weak gaming rig.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>DisplacementQuality=1<br>TessellationQuality=1<br></code></span>These define the quality of the effects in the above point. They should general be set to&nbsp;<strong>1</strong>&nbsp;(medium) for everyone, regardless of whether you have a powerful PC or not.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>EnableCaustics=false<br>EnableSelfReflection=false<br></code></span>These settings enable high quality reflection physics for water surfaces.

<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>EnableShadow=true<br></code></span>This determines whether objects like trees can cast shadows on water. I recommend leaving this to&nbsp;<strong>true</strong>&nbsp;for realism for everyone.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>EnableVolumetricShadow=false<br></code></span>A very performance-heavy version of the above. I recommend setting this to&nbsp;<strong>false</strong>&nbsp;for everyone who does not have a modern gaming rig.</li>
<li><span style="color: #ff6600;"><code>VolumetricShadowQuality=1<br></code></span>Determines quality of the above point, if you set it to true. I recommend leaving this to&nbsp;<strong>1</strong>&nbsp;(medium) for most people, unless you have a new gaming rig and can afford&nbsp;<strong>0</strong>&nbsp;(high). The difference in quality is minimal.
